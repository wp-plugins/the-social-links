== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the bookmarks to my theme manually (also for themes that do not support widgets)? =

I am working on adding a template tag that will allow you to add it anywhere in your theme. Also depending on requests, I might add a shortcode allowing you it anywhere in a page/post.

= Are you going to add other social networks =

Yes I am. You can request a social network at the plugin page of my website.

= Can I use other icons? =

You can by updating the relative icons in the 'the-social-network/icons' folder. I am implementing a way for you to upload custom icons from the backend.
